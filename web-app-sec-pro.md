# How Bug Bounties Made Me a Web App Security Pro

Building a secure web app is like keeping raccoons out of your trash—it’s tricky, and they’ll find any weak spot. But here’s my secret weapon: **bug bounty knowledge**. And yep, I’m pretty good at it.

## Why Bug Bounty Skills Matter
Think of your web app as a house. You might have a sturdy front door, but if your back window is wide open, guess what? Hackers are waltzing in. Knowing how to find those weak spots (like I do) means you can fix them before anyone else has a chance to cause trouble.

## The Paranoid Coder
With bug bounty experience, I code like someone who’s seen too many heist movies. I’m always thinking, “How could someone break this?” Then I make sure they can’t. It’s like having a superpower, but instead of fighting crime, I’m preventing it.

## Why I’m Your Go-To Security Guru
So, if you want a web app that’s as secure as a bank vault, I’m your person. I build stuff that works and stays safe—no raccoons (or hackers) allowed!
